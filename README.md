I'm usually hanging around there or someone else can help you out.
The artwork is mine but feel free to fork it or use the code to make your own mdm animated theme.

The animation was made with phaser html5 framework

or better yet, I used the phaser editor which has everything already built in and makes life a lot easier.

It is better to use the editor and there is a linux version.
He put a lot of effort into this editor which is eclipse based and there is a ton of options to use and help guides along with samples already built in.

The phaser website also has a ton of examples to help you along.

Enjoy and happy coding
